Key Features:

Color separation: Red and cyan color channels that shift independently
Clip masking: Creates the blocky, corrupted appearance by revealing different portions of the text layers
Skew animations: Adds subtle distortion to simulate digital corruption
Text shadows: Enhances the chromatic aberration effect
Scanlines: Subtle horizontal lines that move across the text for added retro feel

Technical Implementation:

Uses ::before and ::after pseudo-elements for the color-shifted layers
Complex keyframe animations with random clip values to create unpredictable glitching
Multiple animation timings (0.3s, 0.5s, 2s) for layered effects
Responsive design that scales on smaller screens

The effect continuously loops and creates that authentic digital corruption look without requiring any JavaScript. The randomized clip rectangles and varying skew angles make each glitch cycle unique and visually interesting.
